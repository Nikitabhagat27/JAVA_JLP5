	/**  
	 * Difference between method and constructor
	 * technical:
	 * constructor name must be exactly class name but method name could be any logical name
	 * constructor does not have return type even void but method must have return type
	 * example:
	 *   class Rat{
	 *    Rat(){} //this is constructor
	 *    void Rat(){} //this is method
	 * }
	 * @author prtks

	//constructor is responsible for initilizing the instance variable
	//constructor will initilize thse instance variable with default value first
